wants {
	-can only spawn ~10 max items of each type
	-spamming the button doesn't delete older items
	-items don't expire
	-items can stay long term for a player to figure out what to do
		-to not be frustrated by button spam, timed expiration
	-apply timed expiration to items that leave inside mcdee
		-remove it when brought back inside before expiration
	-have dispenser "run-out" of items at 10 each
		-regains more each time a full meal-tray is "compiled"
			-also when items are thrown in the trash
				-might be possibly abused, but it would be pretty funny
					-(memer1 trying to make a meal-tray, but memer2 grabs everything and throws it away each time memer1 spawns something)
	-"compiler" machine can only make 5 full trays
