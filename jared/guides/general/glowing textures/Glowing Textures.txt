Intro:

This is for glowing textures in hammer. This can broken up into 2 different aspects. Please refer to the example1.png for the difference.

Lights.rad Implementation
-----------------------------
This is when you want a texture to light other textures AROUND the texture.
**This will NOT light the texture itself**

Step 1: Edit the rad file for the game.
		- Go to the tf2 root directory. (should have gameinfo.txt) in it.
		- Create a file called <somelightingname>.rad <-- This file will hold all the textures you want to light other textures
		- Edit this <somelightingname>.rad 	
			 - The format is:
					{texturename} {RGBB}
				Example:
				{
					metal/steeldoor001 210 193 174 200 
					lighted/custom_lightdoor2 210 193 174 200
					lighted/custom_lightedbulbmenu 210 193 174 200
				}
Step 2: Insert the following at the BEGINNING of your lights compile options in hammer
		{
		 -lights <somelightingname>.rad
		}

Surface Illumination
------------------------------
This is when you want a texture to light ITSELF
**This will NOT light other textures around itself**

Step 1: Add a layer mask to your texture
		- In order to let the engine know what needs to be lit, you'll need a layer mask.
		- Open the image in gimp
		- Right click the layer and click "Add layer mask"
		- choose "White (full opacity)"
		- You can modify the layer mask if you wish. I copied a layer mask from /lights/flourescentcool003a.
		- ** Note: You'll need to select "Edit Mask" to actually copy/paste the mask. Also, press Ctrl+H to anchor. **
Step 2: Export image as TGA file
		- uncheck RLE compression
Step 3: Import image into VTFedit
		- File--> Import (Don't change stock values, just hit ok)
		- View--> Mask (This should show you your current mask, if it's white it won't change... i think)
		- File--> (Save as) vtf
Step 4: Change the VMT that references this texture to include the following value:
		- "$selfillum" "1"
Step 5 (Optional/Experimental): Change the tint of the self illuminated light:
		- "$selfillumtint" "[1 1 1]" <-- "[<red float> <green float> <blue float>]"
