// random sht from "fence lord"

	meme bunker with uber and one way entrace and exit doors
		-use that fancy one way door i made
	buttons that rename the player allowing picking of spawn places
		-might not work together with ravenholm g g
			-duno tho
		-boxing ring typea spawn thing
			-maybe have like mcdee, boxing ring, normal
				-somsht
	an arcade
		-gg?
			-chucky cheeses
	spit red garage into a gym, and a convience store
		-heavy boxing ring in gym
	add "Jared's" subshop to the new wallmart
		-inside or outside gg
		-everythings slighty off brand meamy

// things to keep in mind

	lower random unseen brush faces Lightmap scale if vbsp.exe thinks its hit the brush limit
		-found out randomly in sfm when i tried to compile a huge box with one lightmap scale on the whole thing
			-not sure if it applys to tf2 tho, sfm is the BIG dum
				-might have some insight: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Talk:Lightmap#Does_lightmap_increase_polycount.3F

// general changes

	Disable physics collision on the fence displacement border
		-ray cast is still enabled so that should mean bullets still impact
		-coach would like that

	Test moving everything in mcdees on grid
		-using the shift + v, select all verts, ctrl + b method
			-making sure to snap on grid of one

	Clip the drive thru window in mcdees is kinda janky
	
	add transparency to the posters on the mcdee walls

	Better hide the out teleporter in skybox
		-visible in map

	Find some cheaper water texture for the pool


//content concepts

	skybus concept working
		-semi truck drives in from the back road behind wallmart parks at a wallmart® gas pump thus being vulnerable to explosions explodes upon bullet impacts dropping a buncha powerups or merasmuses
			-figure how to use the exploding semi truck from csgo / l4d (meeegggaa sicccck)
				-exploding walls and gas pumps nsht boi
					-gg
	
	underground sewer/matenence area under whole map(or atleast mcdees)
		-dont want to make it too complex / or too simple, so players dont get stuck Hiding from eachother, need that openness
			-make it feel small and dark so memers dont want to stay down maybe
				-not to dark or small tho

	Add big power plugs (the ones from hl2) to the sewer/matenence area underneath mcdees as if the combine had jerryrigged the sheilds onto the building and powered them thru the sewer
		-shoot them off to disable the sheilds/uber/shelid effects (sounds nsht)
		-plug them back in with !grab
		-small delay spawning sparks at the doors mechs before fully comming back online
		-maybe have a lightswitch inside mcdees to turn off some lights in the matenence area making it harder to find and disable the plugs underground
		-maybe a camera and monitor inside mcdees aswell looking down into the sewer



	//birb suggestions
	add a "red army robin" in the mcdee fryer as a chicken nugget meam
	add whole or some part of this song in the mcwallmart secret room, or the animeroom in the bank
		-some filthyfrank song
	bluspawn secret room, make top roght part of the wall passable and teleport to a room filled with sandwiches and heavy birds dancing
